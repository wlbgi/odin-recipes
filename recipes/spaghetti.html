            <li>1 large onion, minced</li>
            <li>4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1/2 pound ground pork</li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) can Italian plum tomatos</li>
            <li>1/2 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>6 ounces tomato sauce</li>
            <li>2 carrots, shredded</li>
            <li>1 stalk celery, chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chicken stock</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 pound pasta</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Warm oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saut√© onion, bacon, and garlic in hot oil until bacon is browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer bacon mixture to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside.</li>
            <li>Place the same large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef and pork in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease.</li>
            <li>Stir bacon mixture, tomatoes, mushrooms, tomato sauce, carrots, celery, wine, stock, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper into meat mixture. Bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer sauce for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook in boiling water until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain.</li>
            <li>Serve sauce over hot pasta.</li>
        </ol>
